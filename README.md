# Learning Statamic

My first project built with statamic following along with [this tutorial](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-statamic-with-jack/)

## Technologies Used

- Statamic v3

## The Project

The overall project will be a landing page based app which will be CMS based 
so the site owner can create multiple landing pages which are content managed.
The project will have blogging functionality with custom taxonomy filtering, ability to search content, custom navigations,
handle displaying images with glide, custom-built content blocks (bard fields) and also custom-built tags.

## Usage

1. Visit the site [URL](https://learnstatamic.herokuapp.com/) in your web browser.
2. Use the [Statamic control panel](https://learnstatamic.herokuapp.com/cp) to create and manage landing pages, blog posts, and other content.
3. Use the custom taxonomy filtering and search functionality to find and display content.
4. Use custom-built content blocks (bard fields) and tags to create unique content.
